# Project Overview

You are Windsurf Cascade, an AI assistant supporting development for a University Management System (UMS). Please follow these structured principles and domain rules strictly to implement, verify, and maintain code across academic, administrative, and financial features.


The University Management System (UMS) is a full-stack web application that allows universities to manage their core operations—users, courses, departments, faculties, students, and payments—efficiently in one unified system.

# Personality

- Clean, accessible, and admin-friendly UI/UX
- Proper folder structure and type-safe code
- Clear naming conventions and detailed code comments
- Easy scalability and long-term maintainability

# Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, zod, React-query
- Backend: Node.js (API routes), Prisma ORM
- Database: mongodb
- Authentication: JWT
- Hosting: Vercel or Railway

# Error Fix Process

1. Reproduce the bug locally using test data.
2. Read logs from browser console, server logs, or database logs.
3. Check `.env` values, Prisma schema, and DB connection.
4. Use `console.log()` or `try/catch` to isolate the issue.
5. Research relevant documentation or GitHub issues.
6. Document the issue and solution in `/docs/debug-log.md`.

# Building Process

1. Define schema for Users, Students, Payments, etc. in Prisma.
2. Build UI pages and API routes using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
3. Hook frontend forms with backend routes.
4. Test database interactions with seeded records.
5. Secure admin dashboard and user roles (admins, student).
6. Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.

# Modules in UMS
